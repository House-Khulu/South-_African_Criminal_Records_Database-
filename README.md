# South_African_Criminal_Records_Database

This is a project based on a simulated database about South African criminal records

# South African Criminal Records Database

# Project Overview

This project focuses on querying and analyzing a simulated South African criminal records dataset using SQL.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate practical data querying skills, analytical thinking, and the ability to extract insights from structured data using real-world–style scenarios.

# Objectives

* Practice and demonstrate SQL querying techniques
* Answer investigative and analytical questions
* Explore crime trends across provinces
* Showcase a complete data analysis workflow

# Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is "simulated data" created for educational and portfolio purposes.

It resembles real-world criminal case records in South Africa and includes information such as:

* Case details
* Crime type
* Province
* Suspect demographics
* Risk level
* Estimated fraud amounts
* Arrest status
* Case outcomes

# Key Questions Answered

The analysis addresses 30 SQL questions, including:

* Total number of cases
* Cases per province
* Most common crime type
* Highest estimated fraud amount
* Arrest vs non-arrest counts
* Average suspect age per province
* Risk level distribution
* Cases per year

# Tools & Technologies

* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* Git Bash
* Visual Studio
* GitHub

# Methodology

1. Imported the dataset into SQL Server
2. Explored table structure and verified data types
3. Wrote SQL queries to answer analytical questions
5. Uploaded scripts and documentation to GitHub

# Example Insights

* Fraud-related cases appear frequently across multiple provinces
* Higher risk levels often correlate with larger estimated fraud amounts
* Case volumes vary significantly by province and year
